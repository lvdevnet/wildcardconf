    <h2>Call for speakers</h2>
    <div class="row">
        <div class="span12">
            <p>Want to try yourself as a speaker? Or to handle a discussion of the question you're interested in? Maybe show some cool stuff that you want to share? That's your chance to shine.</p>
            <p>The event will contain one track. We're thinking that 10 sessions will be just fine, however it can be adjusted later. Each speaker will have half an hour to talk and to answer the questions. </p>
            <p>We suggest the following session's formats to be used:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A short presentation — 5-15 minutes of prepared material/comments by the session leader followed by an interactive discussion.
                <li>Group discussion — Someone identifies a topic they are interested in, others come to join the conversation and an interesting discussion happens.
                <li>Show and tell — You have a cool project, a demo, or just something to show and let people play with that is the springboard for all the conversation in the session. Alternatively, you can invite others to bring their own items to show and tell (perhaps with a theme), and everyone takes a turn sharing.
            </ul>
            <p>Note that call for speakers will be closed on <b>May 1</b>, so the earlier you submit your session the more votes your session can gain. The submitted session will be added to the list for voting during one day and since that moment you can promote it to the audience.</p>
            <p>Please, note:</p>
            <ul>
            	<li>The organizers have the right to decline the speaker.</li>
            	<li>The organizers do not warrant refunding of travel expenses of the speakers.</li>
            </ul>
