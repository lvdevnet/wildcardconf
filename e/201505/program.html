            <p class="abstract">Are responsive interfaces really just intelligent interfaces? Should our tools act smarter? Is it too much to ask for designers and developers to invest that extra mile? A few seconds each day X millions of users means hours saved.</p>
            <p class="abstract">Intelligence and fewer features always wins over ignorance and more features.</p>
            <p class="abstract">Now that we are designing with screen sizes and aspect ratios in mind, we should go a step further and plan strategically to utilize the device data that’s already collected and available.</p>

            <p class="abstract">From collective code ownership to collective ownership, period.</p>
            <p class="abstract">When Frederick Taylor introduced Scientific Management, he institutionalized the divide between the thinkers, managers, and the doers, workers. That institution spread to software development by the way of Project Management discipline.</p>
            <p class="abstract">The industry wraps itself under very tightly knitted power structures, ranging from projects to organizational charts which mainly exists to subjugate people to a class hierarchy. Projects oppress, organizational charts oppress. The employment relationship ties the hands of both employees and employers.</p>
            <p class="abstract">With Agile, we have tried to close that dividing gap. We have used values, principles and practices to try to achieve that. We have had successes, but they are few and far between. Maybe we need to shake up the power structures more to have a genuine impact?</p>

            <p class="abstract">Web apps are changing quickly, and the methodologies and tools that we're given are limitless. Sometimes the amount of options when we start a new project seem unlimited.</p>
            <p class="abstract">That's why we need to figure out ways to narrow down our ideas quickly and at the same time make sure to always take the best decisions.</p>
            <p class="abstract">In this session, we will explore ways to build and improve web applications by delivering results quickly and continuously. I'll cover how we can employ iteration to build and bootstrap products quickly and efficiently, and how pairing enables us to keep the quality at a maximum during that process.</p>

            <p class="abstract">For the past 10-15 years, many organisations have gone through agile transformations, mainly in the software industry. The success rate has not been stellar to say the least. The State of Agile surveys point out that management support and general resistance to change are among biggest barriers to agile adoption.</p>
            <p class="abstract">In my experience,  the root causes for resistance of change and lack of management support are: belief of the importance of maximising resource utilisation, batch thinking and process roll-out positivism, the belief that new processes can be rolled out in the organisation and communicating new prescriptive processes can impact the ways of working for everyone.</p>
            <p class="abstract">These paradigms are fundamentally incompatible with the agile way of working. If an organisation tries to transform its ways of working to agile without helping its members to unlearn these paradigms, the transformation will probably fail.</p>
            <p class="abstract">In my presentation I will provide examples of how these paradigms form barriers to agile transformation. I will also describe my own attempts to help people unlearn these paradigms in order to be ready to adopt new ones. I will conclude my presentation by describing the approaches that I have found working to help people unlearn these paradigms.</p>
            <p class="abstract">My talk will help people in any knowledge work organisation who want to change their organisation into more agile mindset and ways of working.</p>
