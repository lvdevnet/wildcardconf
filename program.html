            <p class="abstract">In a few years Spotify has grown from a small startup in Sweden to a pretty big company with more than 30 engineering teams in four different development offices on two different continents. And we have no intention of slowing down. Such rapid growth carries big challenges. How can we continue to improve our product at great speed, while growing the number of users, employees and supported platforms and devices? How do we stay lean and agile when we grow from a small startup to a big corporation? In this talk we will present how Spotify is addressing these challenges. We will talk about autonomous squads, tribes, retrospective gatherings, guilds, hack weeks, system owner days, and a lot of other ideas we’re experimenting with.</p>

            <p class="abstract">Technological developments are always key to IT folk. We are fascinated by the ever changing train of technologies, doubling of CPUs power and trebling of data. Quite often, we are too demanded to care about the social and commercial aspects of IT business.  Nevertheless, it is an important subject, even from the perspective of what types of technologies we get to try. There is a strong clustering effect at work here. Based on some studies Latvian IT market is about 5-10% from Finnish. So, we are doomed to export. From exports point of view, typical project size is not 2-5 people, it is 10-20 people. From that perspective – the amount, quality, versatility of IT work we are able to attract depends on the number and health of our IT companies, professionalism of people who work for them. All of us in IT are very interested in making Latvia a bigger dot on the European map of IT services. Those of us in late thirties with kids, can very well appreciate the educational aspect of this too. Only about 20% of our high schools teach programming. It is not going to be that easy to get your kid in a school that give reliable 101 about programming.</p>

The only obstacle is, well, The Cloud. IaaS, PaaS, SaaS? Whatever-as-a-Service? What mysterious set of letters exactly do you need to solve your problems? We've spent some quality time exploring these unmapped woods for you, picking the best ideas, technologies and practices, aiming to build an open-source cloud platform that people would desire to use on every computer they got. In this talk, I'll make an overview of platform's central features and ideas behind the key parts of our cloud architecture, such as IDL-free RPC, dynamic service discovery and realtime IPVS load balancing.</p>

            <p class="abstract">Agile teams are test-infected, but what to do when team releasing regularly is more test-resistant than infected? What if there is no unit testing, let alone test-driven development, and what if developers consider themselves too valuable to testing work? In this presentation, I’ll share my lessons learned with a test-resistant team acquiring a skilled tester to help with on-time feedback with hope of ability to focus on developing new features instead of going back to fix the once “done” features over and over again. Serendipity - happy accidents to find bugs without preconceived rational explanation - favors the ones who intentionally vary their actions, and developers too can test if only time allowed and taken for testing tasks that make sense. </p>

            <p class="abstract">Software testing is an incredible waste of money. Its the developers who make the quality anyways. Ditch the testing! — This is still the mindset of so many development teams and organizations. As testing still carries its underrated role, what could we do to prove its value? This session discusses some real life cases and gives tips on using them to demonstrate the business value of testing.</p>

            <p class="abstract">Automated web integration testing is very powerful, yet still immature. This session aims at making this messy ground clearer through proper definitions, an overview of the state of the art, presentation of current best practices, and a reflection on what this domain is still missing to reveal its full strength.</p>
            <p class="abstract">You will learn from the experience gained through 5 months of full-time research and development on the topic, and one year of usage in a continuous deployment environment, with fully automated cross-browser test suites being run in the cloud on every push.</p>
            <p class="abstract">By the end of the presentation, you will know exactly what is (and what isn't) integration testing on the web, what you can expect from it, how your production pipeline could integrate it, and which difficulties we as a community should focus on solving.</p>

But building cross-platform web apps is not so simple and applying responsive techniques can make a huge effort and in some cases is even not acceptable. In his topic Ilya will describe the new approach to build cross-platform web apps that will work on mobile phones, tablets, desktop computers and even Smart TVs providing the necessary level of user experience for each of the platforms.</p>

It became very successful that is why the number of Agile fans in our company start to grow rapidly. Now our community want to bring Agile also to the non software projects.</p>
            <p class="abstract">Our team doing Agile for the almost two years and now I can say that it works. We have released two generation of our product using this methodology and it was really a challenge to do this been surrounded by Waterfall teams and also depending on them. Embedded projects brings their own specifics in to development and of course validation process, we had to find our own way to make development and validation teams work as a one Agile team. In new environment we had to learn how to deal with the defects and how the Stories should be accepted. But the very first thing was showing to our clients that Agile way gives them much more profit than before.</p>
